**Joby** is an AI-powered smart recruitment assistant designed to fully automate the job search and application process.

### How it Works
The system analyzes the user’s CV, identifies suitable job opportunities across the internet, enhances the CV to match the requirements of each role using AI technologies, and finally submits applications on behalf of the user.

Joby relies on a Multi-Agent Architecture, where multiple AI agents work in harmony to perform tasks with high efficiency. This increases interview success rates while saving users significant time and effort throughout their job search journey.

The product currently operates through messaging platforms such as Instagram, with plans to expand to additional channels like WhatsApp and other communication platforms—making the service simple and seamless to access for users.



### Quick start

```shell
npnm intall
npm run dev
```
### Problem Statement
In today’s digital job market, the job search process has become exhausting, complex, and time-consuming, especially with the growing number of platforms and increasing competition for opportunities.

Despite the availability of thousands of online job postings, job seekers struggle to find suitable opportunities and apply efficiently, which significantly reduces their chances of securing interviews.

#### 1. A Fragmented and Time-Consuming Search and Application Process

Job seekers must navigate multiple job boards and platforms.

Repeated manual applications consume many hours each day.

There is no unified system to manage and track job applications effectively.

#### 2. CV Misalignment with Job Requirements

Applicant Tracking Systems, known as ATS, use automated filters that reject non-optimized CVs.

Most users lack the knowledge to tailor their CV for each specific role.

Submitting a generic CV significantly lowers the chances of reaching the interview stage.

#### 3. Lack of Intelligent Guidance in Selecting the Right Opportunities

Users often apply for roles that do not match their skills or experience.

The absence of intelligent opportunity analysis leads to low response rates from employers.

As a result, job seekers invest substantial time and effort in an inefficient process with low interview conversion rates, creating an urgent need for a smart solution that fully automates the process and improves outcomes.

### Value Proposition

Joby empowers job seekers to secure more interviews with less effort by automating the job search and application process using artificial intelligence.
